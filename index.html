              Although COVID-19 has affected households from working, broadband corporations continue to bill monthly. During March, multiple corporations decided to eliminate late fees for only <b> 60-days </b>… Although the pandemic has lasted for
              over six
              months. Many publications such as the New York Times and Washington Post have criticized these corporations for not lowering their prices or eliminating them altogether.

              Throughout the peninsula over 13,000 of households are without broadband access. According to the 2010 Census data, <u> Far Rockaway which predominantly consists of Black and
                brown residents have <b> 62%</b>
                of broadband access </u>, but with speed to be

              As digital is the norm for educational purposes, schools on the peninsula are forced to deplete their electronic devices for students without access. Scholars Academy, on Beach 9th,
              had given
              away over <b>600</b> laptops to students to continue
              with their schooling from home. <u> Sadly, with slow broadband access, it makes students accessing services such as google classroom, zoom, and other applications difficult to access.</u>
